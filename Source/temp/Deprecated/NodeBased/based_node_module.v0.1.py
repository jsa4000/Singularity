# TEST NODE BASED MODULE #
##########################

# The idea with a node based workflow is to simplify the generation of any logic or bahaviour without the need to generate python code.
# This module is to generate the basic functionality to dynamically create a workflow model based on nodes using JSON for definning all the behaviour and parameters.

# The approach is going to be based in Nodes so a node can be connected to multiple nodes.
# Each node could have multiple inputs (properties) and outputs (functions). The atrributes (channels) can be linked with the outputs.
# The nodes process an evaluation function. 

# An ideas is that Nodes will inherit from an class that also perform aome task to ppre-process and post-porcess the data after and before the evaluation takes place.
# Some links regarind this implementation are:
#   http://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/88199/implementing-a-graph-based-material-system
#   http://stackoverflow.com/questions/645354/implementing-a-node-based-graphical-interface
#   http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5493474/graph-implementation-c
#   http://wiki.tcl.tk/8537

# In order to draw the nodes in order to compose the Flowchart the best option in to consider the JavaScript library for this pourpose.
# http://www.debasish.in/2014/02/building-assembly-control-flow-graphcfg.html

#BASIC COMPONENTS

    # Nodes will be composed by:
    
        # Attributes: These can be generic attributes like visible, locked, forward, backward, etc..)
        #             Also the attributes can be something specific to that Node, like temp variabbles, params, biases, files I/O, etc..
        #             This mean nodes not only will be composed by inputs amd outputs

        # Inputs: These inputs are like the initializations parameters that the node will use. Could be similar that constructors parameters.
        # Outputs: The output generically speaking will be unique. the output will be the result operation of the eval function.
        #           Also, the Outputs could be any attributes or some specific function implemented specific for that node. e.g. Get_Amount_Values, Get_Shapes.  

        # Inner funcitonality (Pre-process, post-process, evaluation, get_shape, etc...) This will be manage by an abstract class
        #               
    
        # NOTE: The implementation that will be used for the pre-process, evaluation, etc.. could be also generated using node based graph or python code insted. 
        #       Another approach is to indicate if the field is an input, output, inferred, ec

    #  Links and connections must be represented. 

        #The link are connection between a node to another. The links it will connect an outputs attribute from a Node to an input node from another.

        # NOTE: These Links are going to connect instances for Nodes from inputs to outputs. Instances are imprtant because each instance
        # will have theirs's own properties and configuration (initialization). 

    # Functions

        # Fnctions that will be used as interface to do all the operation independent from the technology, backend, etc being used

    # NOTES:
    #   However the implementation will be the same and the logic. For this particular reason it will
    #   be important to optimize the size of the data stored to serialize the instances in order to not repeat too much information. 
    #   In HDF5 ard cpickle modulues the serialization is done by using the internal binary codification. This mean the loginc will be stored for each instance. I must differenciate
    #   between instance and new assembly or configuration.
 
# In order to do that we need to create a basic classes with this functionality before doinf anythin

# Base Class
# Base class will have the basic strucuture to create a class from it's attributes.
# This class will have an sctrucuture similar to JSOn using dictionary in order to create the hierarchy and functionality to the classes.

# EXAMPLES TO CREATE DINAMICALLY OBJECT FROM A TYPE BASE FUNCTION.
   
#An example that craeated a class that inherits from the baseclass

#class BaseClass(object):
#    def __init__(self, classtype):
#        self._type = classtype

## This class returns a class that has been dinamically created 
#def ClassFactory(name, argnames, BaseClass=BaseClass):
#    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
#        for key, value in kwargs.items():
#            # here, the argnames variable is the one passed to the
#            # ClassFactory call
#            if key not in argnames:
#                raise TypeError("Argument %s not valid for %s" 
#                    % (key, self.__class__.__name__))
#            setattr(self, key, value)
#        BaseClass.__init__(self, name[:-len("Class")])
    
#    newclass = type(name, (BaseClass,),{"__init__": __init__})
#    return newclass

#def set_x(self, value):
#    self.x = value

## This add to the Subclass a new method that is already defined.
#SubClass = type('SubClass', (BaseClass,), {'set_x': set_x})
## (More methods can be put in SubClass, including __init__().)

##Example using this class
#obj = SubClass()
#obj.set_x(42)
#print obj.x  # Prints 42
#print isinstance(obj, BaseClass)  # True

# Create a function using exec

code = ""
for index, line in enumerate(arraycode):
   code += line + ("\n" if index < len(arraycode) - 1 else "")

# The way I must to think with Nodes is like a JSON schema. For example a simple Node like SUM will be the following.
# First declare the attributes or parameters for the Node. These parameters will be inserted into the dictionary of the base class.

# Possible Origins for parameters:

# 1. Parameter is a default value (1, 45.4, "Marco", etc..). Depending on the type of input or outputs this parameter sometimes has no sense.
# 2. Parameters is a default function. This mean we could implemente a custom lambda function that will correspond to the origin. This function will use
#    some of the attributes of the node Inputs, params, etc... For a parameter could be defficult to know each paramter of the function implemented to evaluate bt itself.
#    -> Could be an option that a parameter will be able to evaluate it self using the parameters the user ha configured.
# 3. Parameters is a link between other parameters. In this case the parameter must be evaluated recursively until found a final value 
# 4. For paramters that are neither Inputs or outputs these value could be anything.



# Note: think value must be evaluated every time the parameter is called... not saved. Maybe eval must be called by value instead..
