Install MongoDB On Windows

To install the MongoDB on windows, first download the latest release of MongoDB from http://www.mongodb.org/downloads Make sure you get correct version of MongoDB depending upon your windows version. To get your windows version open command prompt and execute following command.

	C:\>wmic os get osarchitecture
	OSArchitecture
	64-bit
	C:\>

32-bit versions of MongoDB only support databases smaller than 2GB and suitable only for testing and evaluation purposes.

Now extract your downloaded file to c:\ drive or any other location. Make sure name of the extracted folder is mongodb-win32-i386-[version] or mongodb-win32-x86_64-[version]. Here [version] is the version of MongoDB download.

Now open command prompt and run the following command

	C:\>move mongodb-win64-* mongodb
	   1 dir(s) moved.
	C:\>

In case you have extracted the mongodb at different location, then go to that path by using command cd FOOLDER/DIR and now run the above given process.

MongoDB requires a data folder to store its files. The default location for the MongoDB data directory is c:\data\db. So you need to create this folder using the Command Prompt. Execute the following command sequence.

	C:\>md data
	C:\md data\db

If you have install the MongoDB at different location, then you need to specify any alternate path for \data\db by setting the path dbpath in mongod.exe. For the same issue following commands.

In command prompt navigate to the bin directory present into the mongodb installation folder. Suppose my installation folder is D:\set up\mongodb

 
	C:\Users\XYZ>d:
	D:\>cd "set up"
	D:\set up>cd mongodb
	D:\set up\mongodb>cd bin
	D:\set up\mongodb\bin>mongod.exe --dbpath "d:\set up\mongodb\data" 

This will show waiting for connections message on the console output indicates that the mongod.exe process is running successfully.

Now to run the mongodb you need to open another command prompt and issue the following command.
	 
	D:\set up\mongodb\bin>mongo.exe
	MongoDB shell version: 2.4.6
	connecting to: test
	>db.test.save( { a: 1 } )
	>db.test.find()
	{ "_id" : ObjectId(5879b0f65a56a454), "a" : 1 }
	>

This will show that mongodb is installed and run successfully. Next time when you run mongodb you need to issue only commands.

	// Start Server
	D:\set up\mongodb\bin>mongod.exe --dbpath "d:\set up\mongodb\data" 
	// Connection Client
	D:\set up\mongodb\bin>mongo.exe
	
Connection string URL (to connect through mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost:27017'); )
	
	To describe a connection to a replica set named test, with the following mongod hosts:

    db1.example.net on port 27017 and
    db2.example.net on port 2500.

	You would use a connection string that resembles the following:

	mongodb://db1.example.net,db2.example.net:2500/?replicaSet=test
	mongodb://localhost:27017/?replicaSet=test or mongodb://localhost:27017
